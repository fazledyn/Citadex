# Citadex

<b> What is Citadex ? </b>

Citadex is a drive space where we upload course materials regarding out university courses and others. It is hosted on a central Google Drive which is accessed by the students of our classes through Departmental Email and other emails also. We named the drive <b>Citadex</b> to make it feel like our own. 

This is a simple Desktop Application made using <b>JavaFX</b> to access the files more easily. In the Ramadan vacation of 2019, I had nothing to do. I made up my mind and completed it as I had the idea going on my mind for a long time. 

If you want to work on this project with me, you can surely contact me on my email: rabidahamed@gmail.com. It's an open source project. Which means you can work on it too if you find it interesting.
